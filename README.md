# ðŸŽ­ Face Generation with GAN (DCGAN in TensorFlow/Keras)

This project implements a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** from scratch in TensorFlow/Keras to generate human faces.  
Itâ€™s designed for learning purposes â€” to help you understand how GANs work step by step while watching the model improve during training.

## âœ¨ Features
- **DCGAN architecture** (Deep Convolutional GAN).
- **Generator**: takes random noise and upsamples to a 64Ã—64 RGB image.
- **Discriminator**: CNN classifier that distinguishes real vs fake faces.
- **Training loop**: written from scratch for clarity.
- **Live visualization**: see generated faces evolve epoch by epoch (like a continuous video).
- **Checkpoints**: model is saved every epoch for recovery and reuse.
